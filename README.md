# Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.


I took note of this design when I first saw it in my project. After that I first design a navbar and a static card. Then map it and make it dynamic. Then create a json file and add all the details there, and add it to the card. Then if you click on the button, the name of the course and the time will be shown in the cart. Then subtract the hours remaining from the Credit Hour Remaining, and add it to the Total Credit Hour. Then if someone clicks twice on a course, a toast will be shown (This course was previously added), and if someone wants to add a course of more than 20 hours, a toast will be shown (Course time is over). This is how I managed my assignment project.
